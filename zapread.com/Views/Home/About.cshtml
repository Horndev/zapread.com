                    Zapread.com is a website which combines many aspects of social media, economics, and Bitcoin.  The idea is to create a community which is a self-regulating social economy where content which is of interest is rewarded, and poor content is buried.  Users vote on content produced by authors by paying Bitcoin via the Lightning Network in increments of one Satoshi.  The authors are rewarded for positive contributions, and the community is compensated for poor contributions.
